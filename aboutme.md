<b><bold>Short Bio.</bold></b> Hello, and welcome to one of my homes on the web! I’m Josua Naiborhu, an independent consultant, machine learning engineer, and a big fan of [Guido van Rossum](https://gvanrossum.github.io/) and [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://www.stroustrup.com/). I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from [Universitas Indonesia](https://ee.ui.ac.id/). With over 5 years of experience in various industries, I have utilized AI capabilities to solve business problems in insurance, transportation, and education. My areas of expertise include applied mathematics, machine learning, and software engineering practices. I share [my not-so-profound thoughts on experimenting with data](https://naiborhujosua.com/).  

<b><bold>Fun Facts.</bold></b> I like [reading books](https://naiborhujosua.com/bookshelves/) with [drawaurora](https://www.drawaurora.com/) in the background, contributing to [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), and running. I also do a two-minute wall sit and plank daily.

<b><bold>Contact.</bold></b> To get in touch with me, you can send an e-mail to <hi@naiborhujosua.com>. I am always happy to share feedback on any technical challenges across the entire Machine Learning lifecycle.

<b><bold>Note.</bold></b> I am not pursuing employment opportunities or scholarships. Any organization or company that would like to consult or discuss machine learning/deep learning-based solutions that further streamline business processes and workflows can schedule my time by [booking a personalized consulting session](https://calendly.com/naiborhujosua/60min?month=2024-05).
