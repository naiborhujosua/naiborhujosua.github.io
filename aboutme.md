<b><bold>Short Bio.</bold></b> Hello, and welcome to one of my homes on the web! I’m Josua Naiborhu, an independent consultant, machine learning engineer, and a big fan of [Guido van Rossum](https://gvanrossum.github.io/) and [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://www.stroustrup.com/). I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from [Universitas indonnesia](https://www.ui.ac.id/). I can speak 3 languages, Indonesian, English, and japanesse. With over 5 years of experience in various industries, I have utilized AI capabilities to solve business problems in insurance, transportation, and education. My areas of expertise include applied mathematics and software engineering practices. I share my not-so-profound thoughts on experimenting with data.  

<b><bold>Fun Fact.</bold></b> I like reading books with [DrawAurora](https://www.drawaurora.com/) in the background, contributing to [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), and running. I also do a two-minute wall sit daily.

<b><bold>Contact.</bold></b> To get in touch with me, you can send an e-mail to <hi@naiborhujosua.com>. I am always happy to share feedback on any technical challenges across the entire Machine Learning lifecycle.

<b><bold>Note.</bold></b> I am neither pursuing employment opportunities nor scholarships. Any organization or company that would like to consult or discuss machine learning/deep learning-based solutions that further streamline business processes and workflows can schedule my time by [booking a personalized consulting session](https://calendly.com/naiborhujosua/60min?month=2024-05).
