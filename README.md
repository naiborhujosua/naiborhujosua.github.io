# Implementation 

The website is implemeted in Jekyll with help of [beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll). The blog posts and website pages are coded in one of the three formats: `html` files,`ipynb` notebooks,  or `md` markdown pages. The notebooks and markdown posts are converted to `html` with GitHub actions, which allows publishing blog posts as Jupyter notebooks. The website includes the dark/light theme toggle, site-wide search, customly design menu pages and dynamic layout changes depending on the screen size.
